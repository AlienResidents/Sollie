maccas will go out and confirm that there are no duplicate MAC addresses in the
environment.  You can also specify the user you want to use for connecting to
remote machines in the short format user@host.  The remote protocol used is SSH.
You can setup shared keys to make the process of checking for duplicate MAC
addresses easier, and quicker.
* why
Even though Oracle claims that using multicast can eliminate duplicating the
MAC address of the LDOMs / OVMs deployed, I've seen way too many collisions
already and I've only deployed a handful (less than 10) OVMs.
