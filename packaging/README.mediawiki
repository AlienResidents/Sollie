I use the pkg-get / pkgutil tool from Blastwave / CSW to remotely install
packages from a custom repo (I don't normally use their repo).  This is a
modified version of the catalog create script that some dude wrote (says so at
the top of the file).

= mkpkg =
This is used to, you guessed it, roll a solaris package (SVR4) from a directory, or
tarball.  I'm sure it could be expanded to create from zip files, but fuck it
for now, I use tar, and so should you.  It doesn't create a complete package as
far as all the little scripts that some people want / require.  I don't need
anything more than a request script (of which at install time, I can feed in an
answer file), preinstall script, postinstall script.  Everything else is
useless to me right now.  I don't see that changing.
