create_zone.manual:
 This is used from a global zone to create a minimal zone manually by answering
 questions.  This script will have the name changed at some point in the future
 as I am in the process of merging the auto and manual scripts.

create_zone.auto:
 This '''was''' used for creating zones automatically, but I'm getting rid of
 this script eventually as it serves no efficient purpose.

zone_template:
 This is the template currently used by both the auto and manual scripts.
 This will be going away at some point in the future as I'll derive all needed
 configuration details from the zone create script itself.
