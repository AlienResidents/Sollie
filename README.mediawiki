This is my repo for all stuff I write for Solaris.

Most of the code is from long, long ago, so it's probably pretty shit.

I'll be fixing it up, but feel free to point out the shit bits before I get to
them.


= packaging =
This is where I keep my solaris package creation tool(s).

= jumpstart =
This be where I keep me goodies for jumpin solaris boxes, yar!!

= zones =
Scripts for Solaris 10 zones.

= ldom =
Scripts for various functions with LDOMs (Logical DOMains) / OVMs (Oracle Virtual Machines).
