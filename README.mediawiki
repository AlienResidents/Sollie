This is my repo for all stuff I write for Solaris.

Most of the code is from long, long ago, so it's probably pretty shit.

I'll be fixing it up, but feel free to point out the shit bits before I get to
them.

= jumpstart =
This be where I keep me goodies for jumpin solaris boxes, yar!!

= ldom =
Scripts for various functions with LDOMs (Logical DOMains) / OVMs (Oracle
Virtual Machines).

= packaging =
This is where I keep my solaris package creation tool(s).

= smf =
Starting with Solaris 10, there is a new method for starting and stopping system
processes at boot time.  This is called the Service Management Facility.  This
repo contains scripts used to generate and or manage the SMF.

= zones =
Scripts for Solaris 10 zones.
